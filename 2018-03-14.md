# Accomplishing Dynamic Dispatch on PATs

(see [PATs video from 2017-11-15 code club](https://github.com/hursley-swift-sig/code-club/blob/master/2017-11-15.md))

Protocols with Associated Types (a protocol that has an `associatedtype`, or that has `Self` requirements - such as if you make it `Equatable`) cannot be used as a type, so cannot take part in dynamic dispatch. We ran into such problems when wanting an `Identifier` to be `Hashable` in order to use it as a dictionary key: doing so makes `Identifier` a PAT, so it can no longer be used in this way.

This article demonstrates a neat workaround
