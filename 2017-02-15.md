# Optionals and String Interpolation

I want to convert an optional variable to a String, eg. as part of a debug or logging statement.
If I simply write:
```
var myVar:Int? = 1
print("\(myVar)")
```
Two problems:
- this will produce the output `Optional(1)`
- as of Swift 3.1, the compiler will warn with: 
```
warning: string interpolation produces a debug description for an optional value; did you mean to make this explicit?
note: use 'String(describing:)' to silence this warning
note: provide a default value to avoid this warning
```
The obvious solution would be to use `??`.
However, `myVar` is not a `String`, and the `??` operator requires matching operands.  For example, this will not compile:
```
print("\(myVar ?? "nil")")
```
I could instead write: `myvar ?? 0` but this would imply the variable had a value, when really it was nil.
How do I provide a default String value in this case?
I want to avoid writing a bunch of extra `if let` code to create a String representation.

A nice answer here: https://oleb.net/blog/2016/12/optionals-string-interpolation/
