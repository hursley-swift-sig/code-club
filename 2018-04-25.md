## Code speed vs. size - Code size optimization in Swift 4.1 (Dave)

Code compiled with `-O` trades off executable code size for execution speed.  4.1 has a new compiler option `-Osize` that aims to minimize code size at the expense of (some) performance.

https://swift.org/blog/osize/

The claim is that, for most projects, size is reduced by 5 - 30%, while performance of 'up to 5%' might be sacrificed. I thought I'd give it a quick try on a simple Kitura project (Hello World).

A quick test on Kitura master (soon-to-be 2.3) and `4.1-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2018-03-09-a` yielded:
```
               | Throughput (req/s)      | CPU (%) | Mem (kb)     | Latency (ms)                   | good
Implementation | Average    | Max        | Average | Avg peak RSS | Average  | 99%      | Max      | iters
---------------|------------|------------|---------|--------------|----------|----------|----------|-------
         4.0.3 |    73031.7 |    74676.5 |    96.9 |        28164 |      1.7 |      3.8 |    200.3 |     5
           4.1 |    71030.6 |    72620.2 |    97.9 |        26733 |      1.8 |      3.6 |    198.0 |     5
     4.1+Osize |    65809.8 |    67033.8 |    97.7 |        27200 |      1.9 |      4.2 |     24.4 |     5
```
...roughly a 7% reduction in throughput.  Comparing executable sizes:
```
djones6@gruffalo:~/Bench-Kitura-Core/latest$ ls -l build_*/release/HelloWorld
-rwxrwxr-x 1 djones6 users 2383952 Mar 23 14:39 build_403/release/HelloWorld
-rwxrwxr-x 1 djones6 users 2438992 Mar 23 14:40 build_41/release/HelloWorld
-rwxrwxr-x 1 djones6 users 2419312 Mar 23 14:41 build_41size/release/HelloWorld
```
Hmm, the 4.1 build was around 2% larger to start with compared to 4.0.3, and the `-Osize` option made less than a 1% difference. This might need some more investigation.

For reference, all builds were compiled with `swift build -c release`, with the latter additionally specifying `-Xswiftc -Osize`.
