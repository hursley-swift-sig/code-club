# Optionals represented as Any

Swift's `Any` type can be used to refer to any other type, including optionals. Things then become interesting when it interacts with the type check operator (`is`).

The following code:
```swift
var somevalue:Int? = 3
var another:Int = 4

var box:Any = somevalue as Any
var box2:Any = another as Any

if box is Int {
	print(String(describing: box))
} else {
	print("Wasn't an int")
}

if box2 is Int {
	print(String(describing: box2))
} else {
	print("Wasn't an int")
}
```
results in:
```swift
Optional(3)
4
```
This was the source of a bug in SwiftyJSON's LclJSONSerialization (Kitura issue 1094), which will currently serialize an `Int?` to `Optional(value)`, which is not the intended result.
