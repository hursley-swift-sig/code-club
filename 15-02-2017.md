# The beauty map and flatMap

Use map to iterate over a collection applying the same operation to each element. So instead of the verbose...

```swift
let values = [2.0,4.0,5.0,7.0]

var squares: [Double] = [] // have to make squares a var as we mutate it inside the loop
for value in values {
  squares.append(value * value)
}
```
...you can instead do...

```swift
let squares2 = values.map {$0 * $0} // note squares2 can remain a constant :)
// [4.0, 16.0, 25.0, 49.0]
```
Of course this works with any type of collection

```swift
let milesToLocation = ["Winchester":5.0,"Thatcham":37.0,"The Moon":238900.0]
let kmToLocation = milesToLocation.map { name,miles in miles * 1.6093 }
kmToLocation // [59.5441, 8.0465, 384461.77] - ooi anyone able to tell me why it reorders?
```

flatMap will 'flatten' one level of a multi-dimensional collection

```swift
let myArrays = [[5,2,7],[4,8],[9,1,3]]
let oddNumbers = myArrays.flatMap { // flattens to [5,2,7,4,8,9,1,3]
    
    intArray in intArray.filter { $0 % 2 != 0 }
    
}
oddNumbers // [5, 7, 9, 1, 3]
```

Or even more concisely...

```swift
let evenNumbers = myArrays.flatMap { $0.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 } }
evenNumbers // [2, 4, 8]
```
A really cool feature of using flatMap is that it will return an array of non-nil values

```swift
let optStrings: [String?] = ["This", nil, " is", " a", nil, nil, " test"]
let strings = optStrings.flatMap { $0 }
strings // ["This", " is", " a", " test"] - this is a [String]
```

...applause here.....

# Optionals and String Interpolation

I want to convert an optional variable to a String, eg. as part of a debug or logging statement.
If I simply write:
```
var myVar:Int? = 1
print("\(myVar)")
```
Two problems:
- this will produce the output `Optional(1)`
- as of Swift 3.1, the compiler will warn with: 
```
warning: string interpolation produces a debug description for an optional value; did you mean to make this explicit?
note: use 'String(describing:)' to silence this warning
note: provide a default value to avoid this warning
```
The obvious solution would be to use `??`.
However, `myVar` is not a `String`, and the `??` operator requires matching operands.  For example, this will not compile:
```
print("\(myVar ?? "nil")")
```
I could instead write: `myvar ?? 0` but this would imply the variable had a value, when really it was nil.
How do I provide a default String value in this case?
I want to avoid writing a bunch of extra `if let` code to create a String representation.

A nice answer here: https://oleb.net/blog/2016/12/optionals-string-interpolation/
